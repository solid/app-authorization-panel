## Agenda

### UC Survey Review

JB: Goal established last meeting to get to a checkpoint on survey today so that it is referenceable

Action Item: Panel members to clarify whether they plan to do an implementation (server or client) on each point. Ahead of next meeting.

- PRs
    - Functional Requirements - https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/pull/152
- Clarifying which roles in ecosystem need conforming implementations (elf Pavlik)
    - do you mean "Requirements: minimum two (=2 servers and 2 clients)? independently built public implementations per feature" ( https://hackmd.io/ziy5CeDpQw-Fy5yCifhFFg ) or Conformance Classes (eg. https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/#conformance-classes ) ? OK, I think you mean the latter. (Sarven)
    - roles like 'solid storage', 'authorization manager' (targeted by [Web Share API](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-share/)), 'authorization agent' (as in [Interop spec](https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/#data-authorization-agent))
