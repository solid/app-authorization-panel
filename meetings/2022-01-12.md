## Topics

### ACP Implementation

* Matthieu: A [basic implementation of the ACP algorithms](https://github.com/solid/access-control-policy) has been published on the solid GitHub organisation.
* Justin: Is there a discussion about pluggin it into CSS?
* Matthieu: It is not planned yet, just mentioned so far. So not prioritized yet.


### Access Delegation

* [Use Case: Delegating subset of received access to another agent](https://solid.github.io/authorization-panel/authorization-ucr/#uc-delegation-subset)
* [Issue: Delegation chains](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/issues/222)

#### Access Delegation - Interoperability

* Elf: I put the description in the [Solid Application Interoperability](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/discussions/281) discussion.
* Wouter: Could maybe a bot be added to the diagram?
* Elf: Even those would be considered as acting on behalf of the social agent from the perspective of this diagram.
* Wouter: So you'd still need a WebID?
* Elf: Yes, possibly grants could be used.
* Justin: We have done user client credential grants and WebID, both work great.
