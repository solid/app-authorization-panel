## Topics

### Ideas for access modes and corresponding operations in the Protocol
URL: https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/253


* **Kjetil**: I posted some ideas around operations we should be specifying in the protocol spec.
* ...: Access modes are generally defined in various access control systems
* ...: Protocol should define operations, based on what happens on the HTTP layer.
* ...: Access control systems like WAC and ACP define the access modes.
* ...: We should come up with something which we can continue in the spec repo.
* ...: There is a lot of legacy and thought that went into solid over the years.
* ...: We are not greenfielding, we should be careful what we can bring to the spec repo.
* **Pavlik**: ACP stays agnostic to access modes, it just helps to define which mode should be used.
* **Henry**: Note, the issue is getting very long and difficult to follow. We should move it into discussion so that we can use threading there.
* ...: I would like to bring WAC and ACP together so that we can converge to one spec.
* ...: To do this it helps to see the problems from a very general mathematical perspective to see what the structures behind what we are doing are. I've done some work in terms of modeling the [web server with lenses](https://gitlab.com/web-cats/CG/-/issues/28) in the past weeks. 
* **Sarven**: To get back to Kjetil, he should wrap up the context and we can move on with details
* ...: I understand that we are interested in operations, and how they can be realized with access modes. The notion of create can be written in many different ways.
* **Pavlik**: ...
* **Sarven**: Justin's use case sounds like a centralized scenario, which is fine, but normally we talk about decentralised annotations and notifications.
* ...: This use case relies on the notion of a creator. This seems to be a hidden requirement.
* ...: If we track the creator we shouldn't have problem to handle that use case.
* ...: But I think we should focus on operations, or is tracking the creator the objective?
* **Kjetil**: I have problem with use case defining a specific way on how things get stored.
* ...: If you don't do it you can derive it from other requirements
* **Pavlik**: I am OK to have a 'centralised' use case ... similar to gh forks.
* **Henry**: I am also not against a centralised use case in this case. The creator use case is very useful creator use case, and is part of [our use case document](https://solid.github.io/authorization-panel/authorization-ucr/#collection-readcreatedelete). We want for example to allow people to comment on blog posts, and only be able to edit their comments.  We can do this on each resource individually by just linking to one `agent`. But we want to do this more generally, and be able to use OWL class to restrict the agent description. But I think this is more complicated than it at first seems. 
* ...: You want to say that the agent who created the resource is the same as the one accessing it.
* ...: The simple answer of having a collection of creator agents seems too simple: everyone is the creator of something, so who would not fit in that set?
* **Henry**: should I open new issue on how we can model such a rule?
* **Sarven**: I don't think this problem should be solved on authz level
* ...: We almost had consensus on where we store server-managed data. The creator could be stored there.
* **Henry**: How to store the attribute is not the problem I think. Rather it is how to specify a default rule that would state, in a generic way, that all resources in a container can be edited only by their creators.
* **Pavlik**: Creator could be captured using different property when we specify access modes.
* **Henry**: The problem we need to solve is how do you write an access-control rule where every resource can be deleted by its creator? Ideally we would want to do it with OWL. 
* **Sarven**: If we remove creator from the use case posted by Justin it falls apart.
* **Kjetil**: The relation between AuthZ work in various groups we need to specify. As I understand in interop, is that right? 
* **Pavlik**: In the interop panel we focus on: Roles for resources; Columns for users. acp/wac focus on projecting access matrix on resources, in interop we project access matrix on users, which resources users can access. [![access matrix image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/876431/105429915-08b54500-5c18-11eb-81c2-31f9b3a60ec1.png)](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/discussions/203#discussioncomment-610302))
* **Matthieu**: In ACP, the notion of creator can be used to define matchers. There is no default involving the creator. From ACP's perspective, it is a solid protocol thing (or in other words, ACP expects the creator of a resource to be fed to it as input to match it, if it is used).
* ...: On the other hand, ACP uses the notion of owner for default permissions (the owner of a resource can always edit its access control rules) (note that ACP also expects a server to be given the owners of a resource being accessed, it is also a Solid protocol thing).
* ...: Obviously, it would be possible to define rules involving a creator and apply them by default (using the inheritance mechanism).
* ...: See also the ACP [agent matcher](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/blob/initial-acp-spec/proposals/acp-specification/index.html#agent-matcher) concept described in the spec
* **Henry**: To get back to Elf's point above, I want to point out that we now have 3 authrization systems being developed. WAC, ACP, and the interop panel. This seems like unecessary duplication of work.
* ... The Interop panel work I guess is as I understand about limiting access to application. But as per [discussion 258: Use WAC ontology for authorizing authentication](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/discussions/258) we can use the WAC ontology to authorize app authentication. wac can be used to say this App can read these resources. For example one could have a rule that says: only authorize the bank app to be given signed headers for these three web sites.
* **Barath**: ultimately systems work well when they are pluralistic. we don't need to produce a single answer.. we can't forsee all future Use Cases.. talking about diverse world might be using this thing.. what i'd like to see is.. it is OK to see different specs.. as long as there is loose interop. and people can migrate... web works through coexistence.. 
* **Pavlik**: translating data grants into ACP rules. data grants give a way for auth agents or auth apps.. owned by different users.
* **Kjetil**: purpose of the issue i opened is to establish baseline interop. By putting in the protocol spec's the various operations we see coming out of this.. on the greater issue of diversity of work: there is more of a balancing act. Unecessary divergence is  likely to hurt interop. on the other hand, being too restrictive may stop people from being creative and that is also bad. 
* **Sarven**: +1 protocol spec as baseline.
* **Sarven**: why isn't the data grants being translated to WAC?
* **Pavlik**: EricP were looking into translating to WAC. wac-ucr had list of limitation found in that process.
* **Sarven**: WAC.. ns/auth/acl is basic access control ontology, it should be able to do a lot of stuff for you. There is long list of things the can also be done which it doesn't do - but it can via extensions.. or updating the spec.
* ...: (*The scribe did not transcribe the context for this message but it was a continuation to above; while there is existing work, new work is welcome. the response is in context of operations, access controls, and making fundamental changes to the Solid Protocol re "greenfielding" as mentioned in the comments of the topic issue*) This didn't stop ACP to be considered, unless there are fundamental issues, we can't do greenfielding on everything.
* ...: We have less than 10 people in those meetings and we come up with multiple solutions.
* ...: This panel could be it's own working group.
* **Henry**: If you look at HTML it created a spiral of improvements always working on extending the previous html specs, which at the very beginning did not even have support for images.  We should also build by growing WAC step by step. Of course, if one freezes WAC and pushes back too much, stopping all requests for improvements, one ends up getting split efforts.
* ...: Many of the initial resons given for needing to greenfield WAC and produce ACP were wrong.  We have shown in a number of places that the limitations claimed that WAC had were due to a misunderstanding of the additional tools that can be used to enhance it, such as OWL. But we need movement on both sides... eg. [deprecating wac:control](https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec/issues/94) both simplifies the modes - and will open up some new use cases I have been arguing we need to consider: e.g. access control for public spaces... we want our UCs to be listened to and improve things.. the role of these groups to reach consensus. So we should work on finding the simplest things we can all agree on, and adopt those.
* **Kjetil**: Can we agree that Read and Write can be top level classes. We could reach consensus already.
* **Sarven**: yes. they're class of operations. is there no consensus on that?
* **Kjetil**: Justin mentioned Write could be deprecated.. but that's not the case for a lot of social groups. Idea of having RW as upper classes .. can we have consensus on that.
* **Henry**: yes.. +1 for Read and Write as top level operations. That fits perfectly  with lenses. It is mind-boggling to think that this simple concept is behind so much (OO programming, Dyanamic systems, ...)
* **Sarven**: yes.
* **Pavlik**: WAC's RW or ?
* **Henry**: generic.
* **Sarven**: RW *operations*
* **Henry**: Rread is observation with no change of state, Write is transformation of state.
* .. :Control is not an operation in the way those  two key elements are. Control is of course an essential part of "access control", as per the work from 1992 [Access Control in distributed systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/155183.155225). What Abadi, Burrows, Lambson and Plotkin started developing there is that control is built on the notion of "saying that". In particular in N3 this gives us
```Turtle
{ ?s controls ?p } => { ?s says ?p. ?p a log:Truth }
```
i.e. someone controls something if when they says something about it, it is true. E.g. a home owner can says don't go into house, and thereby it is true. He has the last decision. This is what is known as a  speech act. It is about making true by saying, rather than observing that something is true. 
* **Sarven**: I don't think there are big differences between ACL and ACP. It's not like capability vs ACL.
* **Pavlik**: 
* **Kjetil**: we're also talking about modify, create, delete.. and so on. how many operations will we bring in to the specification. Also we have to consider how the HTTP protocol sees them. There are a lot of things there to consider.
* **Pavlik**: I find it confusing to call both operation and access mode 'Read', 'Write'.
* **Henry**: Read is an observation function on a state S to some representation A
```scala
   read: S -> A
```
Write is a function that gives a representation A and a state and changes it to a new state
```scala
   write: S × A -> S 
  ```
* **Sarven**: ...
* **Sarven**: We can introduce new access model to Delete, it seems to just substitute variable name but end result seems the same.
* **Henry**: I think Justin should try to write how this example would work with WAC, and show what Delete would give us.
* **Sarven**: too much intelectualising not enough visible implementations.
* **Henry**: I will write client libraries next month, so I can try out these ideas.
* **Pavlik**: re Read operation on the resource.. ACL seems the nuance of e.g. Read mode.
* **Matthieu**: Even though writing a good UC in order to understand which specific modes are needed is challenging, I think it is the right idea. 
* **Sarven**: we have issue about error codes
* ...: is reading part of creating or something different?
* ...: for example when you do PUT, if it gets updated you get 201 if created 200 or 204
* ...: we should clarify it 
* **Henry**: We should organize problems and prioritize how we dive into them.
