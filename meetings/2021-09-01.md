**Pavlik**: merging

### [Ideas for access modes and corresponding operations in the Protocol#253](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/253)

**Henry**: I like the image on issue 253 issue a lot. It has three main modes: Read, Write, and Control.

The top level of Read and Write are for sure very solid. 
Indeed, I have [implemented a Web Server](https://github.com/bblfish/lens-play/blob/master/src/main/scala/server/Server.scala) using 
a very simple data structure for containers, together with a concept from Functional Programming 
called Lenses (see [An Introduction to Lenses in JS](https://medium.com/javascript-inside/an-introduction-into-lenses-in-javascript-e494948d1ea5)). 
Lenses are essentially built out of two types of operations: getter and setters;
or Read and Write operations. With those operations, one can build up all
an LDP web server. 
Having said that about Read/Write, I think Control is in the wrong place. 
I don't see it as type of mode, I see it as relation.

**Eric** I think this is just a linguistic confusion. Control just stands for edit the 
access control resource.

**Sarven** Some other ACL mechanisms model control, they also use term owner. Google's ACL uses owner.

**Pavlik** 

**Sarven** In WAC we treat ACL as data points as well. Even possibility of ACL (just as any resource) having ACL suggests that they should be considered as data point.
I agree that it can be achieved in a different way. The aspect of operations has been in the protocol for quite a while. 
Operations are not just atomic modes, but classes of operations; for instance, `write` includes `create` and `delete`. See https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec/issues/85 .
I talked to Kjetilk about why create the operation issue under authorization-panel - it was to create engagement / get feedback from the panel. Protocol has some of those definitions
of operations and WAC currently defines mapping of HTTP methods to access modes only to inform developers. 
Currently, operations are normative, whereas specific HTTP methods are non-normative.

>A request may entail one or more operations, including a processing operation depending on target resource that breaks down to specific operations on one or more resources.

https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec/issues/85#issuecomment-913456115

e.g., `PUT` typically needs only `Write` mode, but `PUT + If-None-Match: *` would need both `Write` and `Read`.

**Henry** 
  To Eric's point above: the reason I am reaching out to Category Theory, is that 
it is the mathematics of structures. What it tells us is that Dynamic Systems can be
modelled using essentially just these Read and Write operations. See the maths
discussed on [web-cats](https://gitlab.com/web-cats/CG/-/issues/28#note_666179055). 
Since we can also do [without Control mode](https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec/issues/94), 
that indicates that it is not a structural necessary piece at the level of Read and Write.
It should be modelled differently (via the `Link` header).
  
**Sarven** `PATCH` can include `DELETE`, so in that case it will require `read` and `write`.

**Pavlik** can we have `Write` without `Read`?

**Pavlik** How do we see that `List` mode? can we separate reading container description and the list of containment triples?

**Sarven** `List` would be limited type of `Read`. It seems that we are coming to consensus on listing containers. We have this understanding of what container is, and what container description can be. The starting point seems to be that description includes containment. There is legitimate case to get some useful information.

**Justin** having `Update` / `Modify` on container means for me that one can change the non-server managed (containment) triples. To change those one would need `Create` (which would result in adding) and `Delete` (removing)

**Sarven** I'd like to see actual applications before hypothesising.

**Henry** I think we should take some use cases, try to implement them as we have done in
[the evaluation section](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/tree/main/proposals/evaluation) 
and see if we can use the minimal `Read`/`Write` modes, and then we can try our best using existing modes, and then see why exactly a new mode would be necessary.

**Pavlik** I don't think `Append` on a container should imply `Create`; it should only allow adding new statements to the container resource.

**Justin** Access Modes should provide specificity to define access exactly the way one wants.
When it comes to dogfooding, it's hard if current systems don't support it. We do have use cases which detail `Create`, `Delete`, `Update`, and real world cases where current access modes lead to over-permissioning. I would like to understand what else is requested besides use cases that are already included.

**Henry** re append, I thought a bit about [it here](https**//gitlab.com/web-cats/CG/-/issues/28#note_666387691) with regard to lenses

**Henry** I think use cases are very good. I think we should do what we did in evaluation section, seeing how it would work with HTTP methods etc.

### Other

**Sarven** Minutes should only include what was discussed in the meeting. 
We can fix typos but don't add more information. We should do that in Issues, PRs, or elsewhere. See [my comment on Gitter on May 05 11:31 in Solid/Specification](https://gitter.im/solid/specification?at=609265f3f7e4221825bae33d). 
Assign scribe(s).

**Henry**: Fine, but it happens a lot that the scribe misses out what is said 
during the meeting - it is difficult to listen and type. 
And I would argue that there is also the context during the meeting that can be filled in to help make the minutes readable.
That is also why we have the process of putting the minutes in PR, so that everyone
can fix up what they felt was not clear.

## Actions

Justin: To select a use case specialised on modes and present it in the form of an [evaluation](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/tree/main/proposals/evaluation) 
as discussed above.
