# Minutes

### Consolidated Survey Branch - https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/pull/118

JUSTIN B: Needs review and then can be merged
JUSTIN B: Can close out the branches that were merged from this (individual pulls)

### Block Access to Bad Actors - https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/pull/112

PAVLIK - Don't want people to think that this is our only approach to spam because it's not fully effective

JUSTIN - Agree though I believe that it's still a valid use case and can be worthwhile to do perimeter blocking even if a malicious user can make new identities. In concert with trusted issuers this can be a bit stronger.

PAVLIK - Also used in concert with trusted credentials can be a better approach than just maintaining list of trusted identity providers. Okay to merge.

HENRY - Blocking is necessary and reasonable to do. Need to add another use case for blocking. If we can make the use cases more inter-company it would be more d-web. Need blocking by app, by user.

### Authorization by Payment - https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/pull/113

SARVEN - How much of this is authorization directly

Justin B: Main issue is that I believe we have other use cases in here that could be used to satisfy this one.

Justin B: Action - Link to conditional access by action, or possesion of VC and merge 

### Limiting Control Access - https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/pull/114



# Action Items
- Justin B: See if gotomeetings can be started before hosts join
- Sarven C: Going to ask Hindia to join Solid CG so we can merge their survey results (DONE: https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/pull/110#issuecomment-704968444 )
- Justin B: Add another use case for blocking (possibly multiple)
- Sarven C: Consider creating a use case on policy/tos/license agreement as a condition to access.
