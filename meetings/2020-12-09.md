Pavlik: Be more specific in the piloted application requirement (#4)

Eric: Change "shall" to "MUST" for anyting related to conformance.

Dmitri: Adjust language on VC to be "possession of a verifiable credential or capability"

Pavlik: Look at UMA approach - authorization server associated with the resource w/ claims gathering step

Henry and Eric: 
 - Explain the process behind the Diff of ACL and ACP 
    (Henry: the idea is to try to find mappings, see if that works, then refine)
 - An idea would be to make a table of of some sort (examples) of how one would express the same thing in ACL, ACP, RelBac, ...
 - Acls on Acls: the issue would be: how does one specify that an ACL should have an ACL (create Foo.acl.acl)? (Henry: think about options and see if it makes sense. Perhaps it ends up making things more complicated?)
