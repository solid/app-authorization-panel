## Minutes

### Use Case Survey

SC: Purpose is to capture use cases that are most desired by the CG. Identify what are people willing to implement and/or use / what is desirable. Others that may cover niche areas or be less compelling may not get as much focus.

JB: How much more feedback / diversity is needed to be representative

SC: For the group to decide - but all panel members should contribute, plus anyone working on implementation.

ML: Deadline on when?

SC: No specific deadline but should try to get done ASAP

ET: Have opinions implementing ESS, but feels like more valuable to get feedback from people using / building applications as they try to apply things. Most valuable feedback comes from those building real-world applications.

### Henry ACP/WAC analysis

https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/128

https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/135

HS: Aim of the work is to make sure we understand the delta between WAC / ACP. Can help with decisions later, translate between the two, or aid in migrations.

JB: Examples of other formalization efforts that have been done against other systems?
