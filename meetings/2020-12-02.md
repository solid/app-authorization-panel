## Minutes

### ACP Updates

Emmet: Have updated documentation around logic of ACP evaluation. Section 4 has been updated:

(Operations are pseudo-typescript)
https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/blob/master/proposals/acp/enforcement-propagation.md

Going into any of those now will have logic explained in
typescript with comments on relevant / important functions.

### https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/141

HT: Tension between WAC spec and ACP related to WAC-Allow

ET: Is meant to be a functional replacement for WAC-Allow

### https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/143

HS: Can this be simplified?

### https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/139

HS: Try to get / track down as many WAC implementations / implementors involved as possible

JB: Also should track down those who have created some custom authz systems when WAC was not sufficient and get roadblocks documented.
