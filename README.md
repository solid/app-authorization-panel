Solid Authorization and Access Control Panel.

## Goal

The aim of this is to produce a candidate proposal to the [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification) that defines a mechanism to allow apps to communicate to users what they want to access while giving the users the power to dictate access easily.

Please see [Use Cases and Requirements](https://github.com/solid/authorization-and-access-control-panel/blob/master/UseCases.md)


## Meetings

Meetings of the Authorization and Access Control panel take place at 10AM eastern on Mondays. Meeting details listed below:
